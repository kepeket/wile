# Wile

A social workout application for Android

## Approach

I just tried to apply Clean Arch on an android app, with the help of talended @SylvainGourdaut.

## Tech

* Kotlin coroutines
* Room
* Hilt
* Websockets

## Features

**As a standalone app**
* Create workouts routines from preset or custom training excercices.
* Change each excercice settings
* Easy creation of Tabata
* Overall routine duration is calculated from your average rep rate, workout duration, and tabata cycles

**As part a group of friends with the app**
* Execute a routine real-time with your friends
* Share your saved routines with your friend by mail or messaging apps

## Roadmap

* Video chat during a real-tim routine
* Performance tracking
